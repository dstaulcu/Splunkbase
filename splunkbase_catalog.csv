DomainTools enables Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and security analysts to take domain observables from their network and connect them with other active domains on the Internet. Those connections inform risk assessments, help profile attackers, guide online fraud investigations, and map cyber activity to attacker infrastructure.

With the influx in events per second rising, organizations need the ability to execute high-volume queries with improved response times. The DomainTools App for Splunk delivers, with enrichment at scale and drill-down details to add context. Leveraging the DomainTools Iris dataset, users have immediate access to dozens of attributes attached to every domain event in Splunk, efficiently delivering event enrichment at scale.

Domain Monitoring

SOCs and Security Analysts can leverage the DomainTools PhishEye product in Splunk to discover newly registered domains associated with any terms their organization currently monitors (such as a brand or company name), and to monitor domains and append domains to your allowlist (list of trusted domains) from the Domain Investigation workflow.

Predictive Risk Scoring

DomainTools Risk Score gives teams with emerging threat hunting skills an instant advantage in helping to identify and optionally alert on Splunk events with suspicious domains they would have otherwise missed. Individual component scores give experienced hunters the tools they need to refine their alerts and precisely target their resources. DomainTools Risk Score, including Proximity and Threat Profile classifiers, is available in both key-value stores and Splunk indexes.

Proven Capability for Enterprise Organizations

DomainTools’ proven solution for Splunk includes a cloud-certified Splunk Application that deploys on Splunk search heads in both standalone and clustered configurations, with and without Splunk Enterprise Security. Event sources can be customized to match the unique requirements of each environment.

DomainTools Capabilities in Splunk

Reduce MTTD
• Bulk enrichment of domains with meaningful context
• At-a-glance alerting and reporting of malicious network traffic
• Domain monitoring using DomainTools PhishEye

Reduce MTTR

Organizations moving to the cloud are vulnerable to unplanned events such as data loss, outages, user error and malicious attacks. While AWS is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, it is the customers’ responsibility to protect the data and applications that are running in AWS. They are also challenged with managing large volumes of data and likely to be using multiple applications to manage and monitor their cloud environment. This presents a visibility problem, where it becomes difficult and time-consuming to monitor key operations such as backup and recovery, leading to reactive decision-making and potential downtime which could be catastrophic.

Solution:
N2WS and Splunk address this problem through an integrated solution that delivers real-time monitoring of backup, recovery and disaster recovery operations to help organizations respond quickly and make informed, data-driven decisions. With the N2WS app for Splunk, IT teams gain a holistic view of their AWS environment, which lets them leverage key data points relating to backup, DR and data lifecycle performance, and be alerted to potential issues.

SIEM Integration is a comprehensive solution for capture, retention, and delivery of security information and events in real-time to SIEM applications. Customers using Kona Site Defender, Client Reputation, Web Application, or Bot Manager (BETA) can analyze security events generated on the Akamai platform and correlate them with security events generated from other sources.

System Requirements

Akamai’s Splunk Connector requires Oracle JRE 1.8+. Download the latest from the Oracle Java site (Java Platform, Standard Edition) or install it from a software distribution package on Linux.

You must have Java installed on the host running Splunk Enterprise https://java.com/en/download/

Also, check to make sure that splunk forwarder is NOT installed on your Splunk Enterprise host machine.

Proxy server

To access the SIEM API from behind a proxy server, ensure that your proxy:

whitelists the domains *.cloudsecurity.akamaiapis.net and *.luna.akamaiapis.net
does not interfere with HTTP request headers for those domains. If, due to a strict enterprise security policy, your proxy does change these headers, make sure that at a minimum you allow and don't change the Host and Authorization headers.

Until recently, the free plan was limited to 1,000 requests/day, and if you needed more than that, you’d need to upgrade to a paid plan. Now, we’re making our free plan even more powerful.

We’re upgrading free, authenticated usage (that is, with an access token) to 50,000 requests/month. If you don’t already have an access token, you can get one for free by creating an account.

Additionally, we’ve added a way for users to help track when they’re nearing their request limit. Users will now begin receiving emails when they approach the limit so that they can take any necessary action before seeing 429 errors.

On top of these improvements, we’re offering a way to increase your free request limit even further! For any free users who are willing to credit IPinfo with a link on their website or application, we’re doubling the standard limit to 100,000 requests/month.

The basic premise is that Jira Issues will contain new information, like status change, new assignees, or new issues created. That's why this add-on uses the JQL*** (Jira Query Language) logic ""get all issues updated in the last 2 minutes"", which runs every 2 minutes. It then parses the JSON response from the REST API and looks for the field ""updated"", (found in the JSON path issues[*].fields.updated) to set the event's _time. Each array element in the issues[*] array list is an event. This is equivalent to saying each issue is an event. Hence, it is important to dedup your events by key or id.

It is important to note that one must use a service / global account found in the configure page. Enter the the username of the service account and API Token for password. To know more about API Tokens of Atlassian, visit https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html

***JQL in this add-on can be changed. It is defaulted to ""updated > -2m"" but the actual value is its URL-encoded equivalent, i.e. ""updated+%3E+-2m"". If you wish to change the JQL, which is doable during setup of a new input, make sure that the interval is relative to the JQL. For example, if you want to modify it to the logic ""all issues updated within the last 15 minutes"", you have to change the interval to 900 (seconds or 15 minutes).

Functionality includes:

Ingestion of ThreatQ Data into Splunk
Enable users to customize what data is ingested by leveraging ThreatQ exports and Splunk input filters. Customization continues for advanced users with the ability to modify leveraged indexes and Splunk saved searches that drive the ThreatQuotient App for Splunk to meet the needs of their environment.

Matching of Splunk Events with ThreatQ Indicators
Provide context on possible malicious activity by matching Splunk Events with ThreatQ indicators. Matching is customizable by ThreatQ indicator status and score to meet the differing needs of customer environments and workflows.

Reporting of Matches in Splunk back to ThreatQ as Sighting Events
Sighting events in ThreatQ will show indicator matches from Splunk and will be grouped by indicator.

Workflow Actions
Users can modify ThreatQ data based on any indexed indicators within Splunk.

Workflow actions include:
ThreatQ: Add Indicator
ThreatQ: Add to Whitelist
ThreatQ: Lookup Indicator
ThreatQ: Mark as False Positive
ThreatQ: Mark as True Positive

Note: Support for ingesting ThreatQ data into Splunk Enterprise Security will be leveraged in the additional workflows provided within that application.

Deployability
The ThreatQuotient App for Splunk has been re-designed to scale to our customers' growing needs, supporting installations in Splunk deployments of all sizes.

Using this app in conjunction with the Splunk integration snippet on NEQTO devices, you can gain key insights about the incoming data flow from individual devices. It is also possible to visualize the collective flow from a fleet of devices.

KEY FEATURES: 

1. You can have remote control. NEQTO Console REST API and NEQTO Console put all your deployed IoT devices at your fingertips so that you can control devices whenever, wherever, and in any quantity. Easily reboot devices, reload scripts, send custom commands, and more.

2. The NEQTO Console makes managing IoT deployments easy. Time-consuming on-boarding processes, such as managing security certificates and encryption keys for devices/cloud, are handled automatically. We cut development time from years to months, or even days or minutes. 

3. Keeping the firmware and scripts on IoT devices up-to-date is an important part of IoT system's operations. Updates can fix security issues or provide new features that make better use of the hardware. NEQTO Firmware can be downloaded and updated remotely. Our machine Driver feature is used to keep all connected devices up to date and secure. It's essentially a component FOTA.

Organizations moving to the cloud are vulnerable to unplanned events such as data loss, outages, user error and malicious attacks. While AWS is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, it is the customers’ responsibility to protect the data and applications that are running in AWS. They are also challenged with managing large volumes of data and likely to be using multiple applications to manage and monitor their cloud environment. This presents a visibility problem, where it becomes difficult and time-consuming to monitor key operations such as backup and recovery, leading to reactive decision-making and potential downtime which could be catastrophic.

Solution-
N2WS and Splunk address this problem through an integrated solution that delivers real-time monitoring of backup, recovery and disaster recovery operations to help organizations respond quickly and make informed, data-driven decisions. With the N2WS app for Splunk, IT teams gain a holistic view of their AWS environment, which lets them leverage key data points relating to backup, DR and data lifecycle performance, and be alerted to potential issues.

- Stores data in the Splunk Metric Store (as opposed to an Event Index),
- Supports Splunk Cloud to AppDynamics SaaS connectivity, meaning you do not need shuffle your data to and from private networks
- Easy configuration with simple toggles to control which apps and data types are ingested, based on Google SRE golden signals to target metrics for each type
- Support for all metric types including Application Monitoring (APM), End User Monitoring (EUM), Databases, Servers & Analytics
- Support for multiple controllers, with configuration of HEC endpoint and metric indexes per controller.

Is the search properly structured? Is data source still being indexed? Are search time range and schedule coordinated? What if the runtime is longer than the interval between one run to the next?

You probably answered these questions while doing the once in a while alert review.

This task however, becomes a pain in no time when the number of alerts rises and, as a consultant, it is common to encounter a Splunk environment in which admins lost track of configured alerts with consequences such as alerts being missed and improper resources usage.

A more efficient way to keep track of active alerts would consist in reviewing them all once, and then only review the ones that have been modified since their last review.

This the purpose of this App: help admins to continuously maintain properly configured alerts.

To do so, the App leverages Splunk KV Store to save active alerts in a lookup that gets updated every time an alert is modified.

Splunk Synthetics Monitoring is a platform to synthetically measure performance of your web based properties. This supporting add-on for Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise demonstrates the value of bringing this synthetic data into the Splunk platform for use in regular SPL queries as well as into Splunk ITSI searches that populate KPIs and Events.

This supporting add-on creates a new command in your Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) called `synthetics` that will bring your synthetics data into Splunk directly from your Splunk Synthetic Monitoring environment. This new `synthetics` command has a set of subcommands to retrieve the right data, and the results can be further processed using your SPL skills. You can create a correlated view that includes data from your Splunk Synthetics Monitoring platform alongside whatever you have in Splunk, including your Log and Observability data.

This add-on also enables you to use the Content Pack for Splunk Synthetic Monitoring within Splunk ITSI, which provides out of the box KPIs, Entities and Services in order to integrate your synthetic metrics into the overall Service view in Splunk ITSI. More information about this Content Pack is here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ITSICP/current/Config/AboutSM

Note: The new ThreatQuotient App for Splunk requires the ThreatQuotient Add-on for Splunk as well as ThreatQ version 4.16 or later.

Functionality includes:

Ingestion of ThreatQ Data into Splunk
Enable users to customize what data is ingested by leveraging ThreatQ exports and Splunk input filters. Customization continues for advanced users with the ability to modify leveraged indexes and Splunk saved searches that drive the ThreatQuotient App for Splunk to meet the needs of their environment.

Matching of Splunk Events with ThreatQ Indicators
Provide context on possible malicious activity by matching Splunk Events with ThreatQ indicators. Matching is customizable by ThreatQ indicator status and score to meet the differing needs of customer environments and workflows.

Reporting of Matches in Splunk back to ThreatQ as Sighting Events
Sighting events in ThreatQ will show indicator matches from Splunk and will be grouped by indicator.

Workflow Actions
Users can modify ThreatQ data based on any indexed indicators within Splunk.

Workflow actions include:
ThreatQ: Add Indicator
ThreatQ: Add to Whitelist
ThreatQ: Lookup Indicator
ThreatQ: Mark as False Positive
ThreatQ: Mark as True Positive

Note: Support for ingesting ThreatQ data into Splunk Enterprise Security will be leveraged in the additional workflows provided within that application.

Deployability
The ThreatQuotient App for Splunk has been re-designed to scale to our customers' growing needs, supporting installations in Splunk deployments of all sizes.

I've created this TA to observe my rental-accounts and gain insights of my personal cashflow. Altough the FinTS library has been implemented the way the FinTS3.0 protocol was designed, not every bank supports it yet the way they should. For issues or troubleshooting regarding the connectivity I suggest you to look into the Git Repo of the FinTS project (https://github.com/raphaelm/python-fints). 

The Add-on provides only management dashboards for online banking accounts, input types and TAN authentication. It contains no analyzation, visualization or alerts of the data. The collected data is ingested as JSON, so it should be usable without any additional field extractions.

Accounts:
The Add-on is based on accounts, they are the first you need to setup. They can be configured in the fints_accounts.conf or using the account management dashboard. Your online banking account requires several parameter to be used like your targets bank Bankleitzahl (BLZ), your banks HBCI server address (Endpoint), if you have multiple numbers under your account your target international bank account number (IBAN) and of course your online banking credentials (User, PIN/Password). The PIN will be stored encrypted (using the splunk.secret) in the passwords.conf. 

Inputs:
The Add-on provides four different inputs which are basically the getters from the FinTS library. Each input can be configured for each account independently. They can be configured in the inputs.conf or using the inputs management dashboard. Each input only requires an account and an input name. To avoid redundant ingestion, I suggest that you use the default cron schedule (see below for suggestions). Also note that the transaction input can query more than one day, however due to consistency I've set it to the last day, so that each input can run once a day. I plan to make it more configurable in future releases. Also I have no available accounts with holdings. So I don't know what this input would return. Feel free to contact me for further development in this area.

TAN Authentication:
For the first time and from time to time it is required to authenticate your access with a Transaktionsnummer (TAN). To authenticate your accounts I've implemented an authentication management dashboard. Since the TAN can be generated on various ways, I try to forward the TAN challenge to the webpage. However my banks support only a few TAN methods, so my development in this area is limited. Currently tested and supported are photoTAN, pushTAN and mobileTAN. Feel free to develope further in this area with your own TAN method.

Suggestion for input frequency by type:

Most administrators do not possess the specific expertise required to successfully design, deploy and configure a syslog server to properly work with Splunk at scale. Additionally, the traditional Universal Forwarder or Heavy Forwarder approach to syslog collection have several issues with scale and complexity. Some customers send syslog events directly to Splunk to avoid architecting a syslog server, which introduces further problems. To help customers address these issues, Splunk Connect For Syslog (SC4S) was developed, a Splunk open source community developed product.

Splunk Connect for Syslog is a containerized Syslog-ng server with a configuration framework designed to simplify getting syslog data into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. This approach provides an agnostic solution allowing administrators to deploy using the container runtime environment of their choice. 

The benefits of Splunk Connect for Syslog include the following:
* Repeatable, Concise, and Prescriptive Splunk solution for syslog
* Removal of the UF reduces configuration and management effort
* Turnkey deployment via the SC4S container architecture
* A library of data source filters we will be continually growing with the help of the community
* Exceptionally even event distribution across the Splunk Indexers (benefits search performance)
* Enhanced data enrichment beyond the standard Splunk metadata of timestamp, host, source, and sourcetype
* Easily add custom “filters” for additional sourcetypes beyond those supported out of the box
* Complete deployment documentation

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. This unique product will be enhanced, maintained and supported by the community, led by Splunkers with deep subject matter expertise. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.

Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.

Too often we see customers struggling with these challenges:
- SOC teams spending hours focused on clearing noise instead of focusing on real problems 
- Bouncing from view to view trying to isolate events that caused problems
- Struggling to build a timeline of events to determine if an issue is real or a false positive
- Correlation that is less about correlating different triggering events and more about identifying something that might be considered ""notable""

The Patronus SIEM provides security teams the ability to easily monitor, detect and react to security concerns based on a scoring system that highlights notables and filters out the noise. Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.  

A basic scoring system was put in place which applies a certain level of risk to ALL detections.  Those detections become compelling as they grow in score and then generate an incident after a prescribed threshold is exceeded.

We believe that many events generate an incident and a timeline vs every incident representing a single event. This greatly reduces the time spent in lifecycle management and chasing false positives.

Quite simply, time is the asset that is most important to a security team.  
- Time to detection
- Time to investigation
- Time to remediate

The process of implementing these configurations to a system can be complex and extraordinarily time consuming. In addition to remediating STIGs on all system components, you must be able to effectively report on and continuously monitor the compliance posture of your systems as they evolve over time. In a lot of cases, this process is managed with Excel spreadsheets and other tools that don’t allow you to get real insights into the data being captured in your compliance body of evidence. Worse yet, the manual nature of completing this work can be time consuming and very prone to human error.

KGI’s Atlas platform includes the STIG Compliance Application that is designed to assist with the entire process of putting systems into a compliant state, managing the compliance body of evidence, and reporting on the state of your system STIG compliance. This is accomplished by bringing your compliance data into the Atlas STIG Compliance App from your STIG checklists and vulnerability scanning systems. The Atlas STIG Compliance solution also includes an integration with Puppet that is capable of putting your RedHat systems into a compliant state and then sending real-time data about the current state of your systems over to Splunk. The makes the Atlas STIG Compliance a comprehensive solution that encompasses STIG Compliance reporting and remediation.

Key Features of Atlas STIG Compliance:
- Create and define systems that represent your environment or your accreditation boundaries.
- Visualize your compliance status at a system and system component level to better understand the quality of your systems.
- Automatically Ingests any STIG or SRG Checklist into Splunk.
- Track STIG Compliance posture over time to build an audit trail of your compliance activities.
- Easily update comments, finding details, status and more for your STIG Checklists within Splunk.
- Save time by bulk editing all of checklists at one time from the Splunk UI.
- Export your STIG Checklists from Splunk in the .ckl format so that they can be opened in the DISA STIG Viewer or imported into external systems.
- Allow teams to collaborate on STIG Compliance activities inside of the Splunk UI.
- Quickly audit your STIG checklists to identify checklists that have missing comments or finding details in your compliance body of evidence.
- Automatically identify discrepancies between your STIG Checklists and your vulnerability scans (SCAP and ACAS).
- Create custom POA&M reports that can be exported from Splunk.
- DISA STIG Templates are included in the App and are visible in the STIG Library feature

Adversary Profiling Means Better Protection
We are continually building and monitoring a pool of more than 10,000 adversary profiles. We identify new adversaries almost daily. Continuous surveillance means we know when they go live on day zero, and levels the playing field by removing the element of surprise. Adversary profiles also mean we can cover a much broader spectrum of potential threats from the same actor, as opposed to most TIPs which simply alert you of a specific threat when it's already knocking at your network door.

Automated Threat Response
The other radical thing Augur does is it generates Indicators of Attack associated with these future threats. Through our integrations with major security solutions, Augur is able to integrate blacklists into your firewalls, web proxies, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, DNS servers, and Email gateways. Protecting you against malicious traffic before there is any risk. And when an attack origin is no longer malicious or there is a false positive, we automatically update our blacklists and adjust your security posture.

The TA also contains a custom-built testrunner framework that will efficiently execute hundreds of tests that match your security policy on each endpoint at a configurable interval and send the results back to Splunk via the HEC. Because of this, the use of a Universal Forwarder is optional and allows for the retrieval of compliance data from architectures for which Splunk has no Universal Forwarder available or when you can't install Universal Forwarders in the first place.

The app itself contains dashboards to help hunt down the most non-compliant endpoints and offers remediation options per failure. The general overview dashboard shows the overall compliance score across your entire landscape and all test suites. Drilling down into the specifics gives more insight into specific test suites and eventually a specific endpoints and test. All tests come with rationalisations and remediation steps based on the specific reason a test failed. Do you think that certain tests are more important than others? Use the built-in risk framework to value certain tests higher than others or use the risk framework to disable to scoring of certain tests if you consider them an accepted risk.

- a CISO to see if your security policy standards are met and if you are on track to meet compliance goals in the future.
- an IT Auditor to quickly validate company compliance standards in real-time, easy to use dashboards. 
- a SOC analist to spot mutations in risk scores for suspicious endpoints during security investigations.

By integrating configurable alert data from Forescout eyeInspect (previously named SilentDefense) with device information and other relevant network activity, this App provides Splunk users with unparalleled contextual information required to identify threats, manage remediation workflows and secure their ICS environment.  

The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk is the ideal solution for industrial asset owners who want to integrate rich OT asset intelligence and threat detection data from across all OT sites within Splunk. Users can leverage the exceptional OT asset and threat data from Forescout eyeInspect to increase compliance and defend their OT/ICS networks from both operational failures and cyberattacks, such as Ripple 20, EKANS, WannaCry, NotPetya, TRITON and many more. 
 
The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk contains three pre-built Splunk Dashboards:
- The Security Dashboard helps the user to identify alert trends and correlate them with other network activity, enabling a faster detection of anomalies, cyber threats, dangerous commands sent to OT devices and device misbehavior. It allows to reduce Mean Time to Response by providing the context needed to determine the best mitigation action
- The Asset Inventory Dashboard  lets analysts access high-value device information and context to better identify unexpected changes in the network, prioritize investigations, and quickly acknowledge new assets, communication patterns, or protocols seen within the network to help asset inventory and maintenance processes.
- The Administrative Dashboard provides deep insights on system health status and user activity performed on the Forescout eyeInspect appliances, to prevent system failure and detect undesired user activity.

The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk automatically maps data to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and the Splunk OT Asset Model.

This app provides users a formidable combination of Splunk Enterprise Security’s (ES) powerful analytics, Splunk SOAR’s automation and massive scale along with Mandiant’s industry-leading threat intelligence, security validation and incident response.

Splunk ingests Mandiant intelligence and information, performs correlation and analysis, and provides dashboards for visualization. The Mandiant Advantage App for Splunk allows organizations to validate if their security controls are operating properly and if Notable Events are flowing into their Splunk ES system as expected. This empowers security teams to rapidly detect and respond to attacks.

Mandiant is on a mission to make every organization secure from cyber threats and confident in their readiness by delivering dynamic cyber defense solutions. When combined, Splunk and Mandiant enable Splunk security professionals to validate their security stack and analyze security events through the eyes of Mandiant cyber security experts.
 

How Organizations Can Maximize Mandiant Advantage with Splunk:

- Mandiant Threat Intelligence, coupled with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, delivers the latest threat research directly to the SOC, allowing security teams to quickly see and detect real-time adversary activity. This information empowers organizations to better understand the adversary and their tactics so they can make informed decisions and take decisive action. Freemium intelligence feeds provide insights into well-known malicious actors, malware families, and maps to MITRE ATT&CK for strategic response.

- Mandiant Security Validation, coupled with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security, allows customers to gain confidence in their readiness to withstand cyber-attacks. While Mandiant tests the efficacy of control points to block attacks, it also validates that event information is being sent to Splunk Enterprise and triggering alerts in Splunk Enterprise Security. With Mandiant and Splunk continuously validating the effectiveness of their cybersecurity controls, customers will have real data on how security controls are performing, allowing them to optimize their environments and make the right investments for the future.

- In the face of a suspected or active breach, customers can use the integration between Mandiant Incident Response, Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Enterprise Security to engage with Mandiant Intelligence experts with the click of a button. This can help customers build their incident response capabilities, respond to active breaches, and bolster their security operations to detect and respond to attacks in the future.",unrestricted,True,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6128/,assisted,simple,1152,0,live,False,no,1.2.0,mandiant-advantage-app-for-splunk_120.tgz,8.2|8.1|8.0,unknown

** Notes to SplunkCloud SRE:
- This app must be installed on searchheads (NOT IDM), and includes a modinput, which must be allowed to run on the searchhead. 
- The modinput contains checks to ensure that it will only run on the cluster Captain in and SHC deployment.  
- The app contains modactions that need to be available on all SHC nodes, so the app needs to be installed on all SHC nodes. 
- The modinput fetches cyber threat observables from TruSTAR's REST API and posts them to the searchheads' kvstores using the kvstore ""batch_save"" endpoint, not an index as most modinputs do.  This is why it must run on the searchheads, not an IDM.  There is no config option that would allow the user to tell the modinput to post the observables to that endpoint on a different host, it's hard-coded to post to ""localhost"".

In addition a new BALANCED savedsearch.conf file will be written LOCALLY in the app for a user to download and install in their Splunk Enterprise system if desired.

A balanced savedsearches.conf file will have the alerts and saved searches all running hourly using each of the 60 minutes in the hour to host an alert or alerts in the most resource conserving manner as possible.

If your Splunk Enterprise system is MISSING or SKIPPING alerts then this app is essential and will allow you to evaluate your alert schedule and optionally install a new balanced savedsearches.conf file which retains all of your alert settings. Just the timing is set to hourly for all your alerts.  This will save you DAYS of using the mouse and Splunk GUI to reschedule your alerts.

By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
•	Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier. 
•	Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
•	Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats  
•	More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
•	Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Integration of the Forescout platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.

Compatible with all cybersecurity solutions, it immediately enhances your detection with contextual information about internal and external cyber threats specifically targeting your business.

Main benefits for user :

INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND VISIBILITY OF FUTURE CYBER THREATS
LastInfosec's technology continuously inventories and evaluates data sources accessible through multiple channels: social networks, specialized sites, the darknet and the deep web, to collect indicators of compromise that are enriched and contextualized to your activity, with the objective of reducing the time required to analyze a threat when it is detected

SAVE TIME FOR YOUR SOC ANALYSTS
LastInfoSec makes it easier for your operational security teams to make decisions and drastically reduces their analysis and incident response time without changing their internal processes. The time saved increases the quality of alert coverage.

REDUCE RISK
LastInfoSec has a library of millions of indicators of compromise (IoCs). Its automated collection, analysis, and correlation engines make threat information available an average of 24 hours ahead of the competition with over 5,500 new validated and enhanced markers per day.

REDUCE NOISE AND FALSE POSITIVES
Because our data is enriched and contextualized beforehand, it generates only meaningful alerts and includes all the information needed to understand them. False positives from your solutions or other Threat Intelligence sources are also mitigated by correlation with our CTI feed.

Swimlane's Adaptive Response Action can create Swimlane cases pre-populated with Splunk alert and notable event data. 

Configuration

You are able to send alert data to up to 3 separate Swimlane instances with each action.  This is provided so you can
conveniently push to produciton, staging, and development instances with one action.

The global configuration is where you will define the connection info and credentials for your Swimlane instances.
1. In the top left corner of the Splunk interface, open the *app* dropdown menu and select the *Swimlane* app.
2. You will see the configuration page where you can define the host, username, and password for up to 3 Swimlane 
instances.

Alert Configuration

1. Once you have created an alert, go to the alert page and click *Edit* next to the *Actions* field.
2. At the bottom of the window, select *Add Actions* -> *Push Alerts to Swimlane*, then fill out the 
fields appropriately. Setup instructions for `Custom Field Mappings` and `Automappings` are in the next section 

Mapping configuration

For the initial setup, use `Automapping`.
1. In the Swimlane application, Create a JSON field with the *field key* `splunkrawjson` and a multi-line text field with the 
*field key* `splunkfieldlist`.  These two fields can be used to see the data being pushed to Swimlane.
2. Trigger the alert so that the action runs, then check Swimlane to make sure records were created in
the desired application.  if no records were created, check the logs (described in the **Logging** section
below) to debug.
3. Open one of the records that was created in Swimlane.  The fields in `splunkfieldlist` are the fields that are
available for mapping.  You can use `splunkrawjson` to see the value each field contains.
4. For each field that you want to push to Swimlane, either use `Automappings` or `Custom Field Mappings` as
described below.

If you select to use `automapping`, Splunk fields will populate a Swimlane field with the same field key if
it exists.  This is the preferred method of mapping since you can still display the info however you want in 
Swimlane by setting the field display name.

All Swimlane field types are supported and Splunk fields containing lists will be properly translated into
list type fields in Swimlane.

Logging

To find logs in the Splunk search, use the following search string:

index=_internal OR index=cim_modactions OR index=* source=""*push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log""

To access the log file directly, it can be found at:

{Splunk root folder}/var/log/splunk/push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log

If multiple executions happen concurrently, you can distinguish which log message belongs to which execution using the `pid`
logged in each message

General logs that Splunk generates can be found by going to *settings* -> *Alert actions*, then clicking on

To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. On average, Forescout customers discover over 25% more connected devices than they knew they had and can collect hundreds more contextual device properties than before. By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
• Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier.
• Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
• Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats
• More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
• Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Now supports automated discovery mode that finds the PEM files you're using to encrypt your Splunk traffic and indexes their expiration date.  Use the dashboard provided as an example to configure alerts, and never let a Splunk cert expire again!

This Technology Add-On is intended to import asset and vulnerability findings from the InsightVM Platform without the use of the InsightVM console. The default configuration will import assets and vulnerabilities for devices that have been scanned since the last import run. Key functionality includes:
- Import all asset and vulnerability data when it runs for the first time
- Track previous import times to only import assets and their associated vulnerabilities that have been scanned in the time since the last import
- Vulnerabilities that are newly found or have been remediated will be imported as new events in Splunk and 
respectively assigned a status of ""new"" or ""remediated""
- Previously imported vulnerabilities that have not changed in status will not be imported as new events and will retain their `found` status
- An optional configuration that allows importing all data every run, or every X period of days.

Of course, there is a leeway between being precise and a global view. This tool can help you balancing on the line.

The CIM Buddy shows you which fields are relevant while you develop a TA with CIM compatibility and present the result of your development. You can examine if your fields are mapped correctly, if tagging works or what the SA CIM searches write into the data model.

		To configure the receiving port, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Forwarding and receiving > Configure receiving > New Receiving Port.
    2) On the computer where the receiving port is configured, create a new index. You can also use an existing index if you have one on the computer where the receiving port is configured.
		To create a new index, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Indexes > New Index.

Configurations:

    * Set up the CommCell page: On the CommCell tab, enter the webserver URL. Enter the CommCell user name and password, and then click Add CommCell.
		Append the webserver URL with the IIS port number, such as :. The default port number is 81.
		
    * Set up the Commvault Clients page: On the Commvault Clients tab, select a CommServe client, and then click Submit. From the Unmonitored Clients section, select the CommServe client and other    clients to monitor. Click Monitor Selected Clients.
	
	*	Set up the Splunk Configuration page: On the Splunk Configuration tab, from the IndexName list, select the name of an index. Enter the IP of the indexer and the receiving port number. Click Submit.

		If you have not installed the Splunk software on the Commvault client computer, depending on the operating system installed on the client computer, enter the Windows or UNIX path of the Splunk forwarder software. You must enter a .msi file path for Windows and a .tgz file path for UNIX.

		If you have another Splunk software running on a client computer, configure the outputs.conf file to point the forwarder to the computer where Splunk indexer is installed. Also, enter the credentials of the Splunk software in the Forwarder Configuration Table. Ensure that this client computer is a monitored client.

Result:

	On the Commvault Dashboard tab, you can see the pie charts of the duration and the status of Commvault jobs. Click the pie chart to get the job details. Click on a job ID to get the job logs.

UPDATE Jan 10, 2022

** The Upgrade Readiness App (URA) on Splunkbase is for ON-PREM ENVIRONMENTS ONLY. 
** CLOUD environments get new URA versions WITHIN SPLUNK CORE RELEASES. Upgrading URA ahead of Splunk Core Releases is not supported at this time.
---

The Upgrade Readiness App is an extension of the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App 2.0.0 and 1.0.0. In addition to scanning your deployment for features and code that might not work with Python 3, it now also scans for jQuery vulnerabilities.

Use the Upgrade Readiness App to prepare your deployment for upgrade to Python 3 and jQuery 3.5. This app can scan Splunk apps installed on Splunk Enterprise version 7.3 and higher and Splunk Cloud Platform 8.2.2107 and higher.

The app's scan results describe the remediation actions you must take to ensure that your public and private apps work as expected after you are upgraded to a new version of Python on the Splunk platform, as well as actions you must take to remove dependency on vulnerable versions of jQuery. For example, scan results show if any apps and customizations rely on Python 2. This is important as support for Python 2 is being phased out of Splunk software.

On Splunk Cloud Platform, the Upgrade Readiness App provides these additional features:
     - Scan search heads and indexers and view a combined report from both types of instances.
     - Request an upgrade of the default Python version from Python 2 to Python 3.

The Upgrade Readiness App is a tool that assists you with your transition from Python 2 to Python 3, and to jQuery 3.5. Even if your deployment passes all checks, you must still independently test your private and customized apps and add-ons for incompatibilities.

The Upgrade Readiness App comes with Splunk Enterprise 8.2 and higher, as well as Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2109 and higher. You do not need to install the app on these versions of Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform.

Unfortunately, those events are too rarely centralized, analyzed and archived.

What OS and software are the devices running? ​
Is there a software vulnerability on the device? ​

Why this application?

Splunk administrators and engineers have to spend a good amount of time and energy to on-board and monitor data sources, which becomes more and more complex and time consuming with the explosion of volume and variety of data.

However, it is very frequent to realise after math that something went wrong, for some reason the sender stopped sending, an upgrade broke a configuration, a network rule was lost, an unexpected side effect of a change occurred, parsing issues are not detected...

No administrator should be informed of an issue in the data flow by the customer or the end users, this is why you need pro-activity, costless and scalable availability monitoring.

with the massive amount and variety of data sources, this becomes easily a painful and problematic activity, this application aims to drastically help you in these daily tasks.

Made by Splunk admins for Splunk admins, the TrackMe application provides builtin powerful features to monitor and administer you data source monitoring the easy way!

UTBox is a set of building blocks for Splunk specially created for URL manipulation. 

UTBox has been created to be modular, easy to use and easy to deploy in any Splunk environments. It only needs to be deployed on Splunk Search Heads and the bundles will automatically be sent to your Splunk Indexers.

One of the core feature of UTBox is to correctly parse URLs and complicated TLDs (Top Level Domain) using the Mozilla Suffix List. Other functions like shannon entropy, counting, suites, meaning ratio, bayesian analysis, etc, are also available.

UTBox has firstly be created for security analysts but may fit other needs as it's a set of building blocks. Enterprise Security users will need to modify the import statement to use UTBox.

This app is the official Common Metadata Data Model app. It will contain everything related to:
- Managing the Neo4j Graph database that is underneath this app.
- Managing the integration with ServiceNow CMDB, Incidents, Problems, Changes, Users, and Groups
- Manage the accounts for writing to the Neo4j Graph database
- Managing the modular inputs to output data from Splunk to the CMDM. So this is the part of getting data out of Splunk to CMDM, also called discovery.

The first integration into the CMDM is focused on ServiceNow CMDB (including relationships), Incidents, Problems, Changes, Users, and Groups. I like to say that this offers a functional integration of ServiceNow with Splunk. As an example one can ask the CMDM to: give me all open incidents for the ServiceNow groups that a particular user belongs to, or give me all servers/hosts that are part of a certain business application. All ServiceNow CMDB/CSDM tables are supported and one can specify which fields/attributes to get over to the CMDM.
This CMDM app is not containing the logic/scripts to get information out of ServiceNow and put that into CMDM. For that a separate container is necessary that has access to the internet, to connect to the ServiceNow API, and connects to where the CMDM underlying Neo4j Graph database is located. Please contact the developer for more information.
This app also contains a new search command called ""gwriter"" to write Splunk content back to CMDM (Neo4j).

To query the CMDM the free ""Neo4j Commands app"" is needed.

The CMDM is relying on the popular and most known graph database called Neo4j. The CMDM can work with all of their editions from community to enterprise to SAAS edition.
And don't let you discourage by the version of this app as the backend code (ServiceNow part) is ready. This CMDM app is going to have a front-end for the configuration of the back-end.

USAGE

Where:
    function is one of:
        sum - add up the values in {mv-field}
        avg - compute the average of the values in {mv-field}
        min - return the lowest number in {mv-field}
        max - return the highest number in {mv-field}
        range - return the difference between the highest and lowest values
        stdev - compute the standard deviation of the values in {mv-field}
        median - return the middle value in {mv-field}
        mode - return the most common value in {mv-field}
    {mv-field} is a multi-value numeric field
    {result-field} is the name of a field to receive the results

    Notes:
    - If {mv-field} contains a non-numeric value then result-field is set to ""NaN""
    - The mode function returns ""NaN"" if more than one value has the highest cardinality.
    - The mode function accepts non-numeric input.

The basic idea is to first encrypt data within an event and produce a new file with the same content as before, but with the data matching group(1) in a regular expression encrypted and saved on disk using base64. The next thing to do is index the newly required file into Splunk with a sourcetype.

At search time, you will then be able to decrypt the data. Read the README.txt for installation and usage. Two experimental dashboards have been added for Splunk 6+ that you can use in your own app to control access to decrypt.

Beyond Identity’s integration with Splunk feeds real-time data about the users and devices attempting to access your critical cloud resources across applications. When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams can ensure only secured devices and authorized users access company data. This stops all password-based attacks and definitively blocks lateral movement, feeding real-time risk signals into Splunk Enterprise Security to help improve threat detection and incident response.  
 
Beyond Identity continuously gathers data concerning the security posture of registered devices and forces their adherence to organizational device security policies.  Real-time risk-based authentication is informed by dozens of user and device risk signals during each login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, dynamic access control across the cloud applications and resources used to operate your organization. 


When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams get:

Strong Authentication Beyond Identity eliminates passwords as an authentication method and cryptographically binds user identity to the device via the secure TPM hardware on the device. This eliminates credential-based attacks and provides a very high assurance of the user identity before allowing access to critical SaaS resources. 

Granular Risk Signals and Immutable Logs Beyond Identity  captures granular device security posture data at the exact time of login such as operating system version,  security software state, and device type. Authentication event data is captured and aggregated in the Beyond Identity Administrative Portal for every login attempt. 

Identify Risky Users Beyond Identity stops unauthorized users and rejects devices from authentication if they do not meet an organization’s security requirements. Unauthorized devices that are not bound to a valid identity are stopped from authenticating. All authentication data is fed into Splunk and normalized to inform threat detection defense                                                                                                  

Event Mapping to CIM Beyond Identity injects data from every authentication attempt into Splunk’s Common Information Model to extract insights about the security posture of device-bound users, their authentication attempts, and the rejection of those who failed to satisfy device security requirements.

- gets graph context within Splunk
- use a real graph database called Neo4j
- integrate CMDB to Splunk with easy searching and exporting
- use Splunk as a discovery source 
- use Splunk and graph as a reconciliation of all data

This Splunk Essential for Predictive Maintenance is created for maintenance reliability leaders and engineers who are looking for ways to improve and optimize their current preventive maintenance program.  To do predictive maintenance right, you need to have the right amount of knowledge on how to process data and then apply machine learning techniques to achieve the desired results.   

Designed for interactive learning, this guide focuses on learning how to solve real problems with real data. Users are provided with details of the predictive maintenance methodology and performance data from airplane engine sensors and then asked to operationalize their analytics. 

The Splunk Essentials for Predictive Maintenance takes you through 4 stages of the analytics process.  Each stage covers :
    * Methodology - designed to cover essential analytics knowledge to practice predictive analytics
    * Step-by-step - designed to apply the knowledge to already included dataset.

       - Stage 1: Data collection and ingestion focuses on how you can easily use Splunk software to collect, store, and structure asset metrics (dataset from airplane jet engines included).
       - Stage 2: Data exploration covers key methods for pre-processing and exploring data to help you understand the type of data in use and the characteristics of the dataset, which is crucial for getting the desired outcome.
       - Stage 3: Analysis teaches you 3 key analysis options (Anomaly Detection, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning) for performing predictive maintenance analysis. In the supervised learning section, there is a complete guide to training, creating, and applying machine learning prediction models to predictive maintenance datasets.
       - Stage 4: Operationalization teaches you how to apply the model to a broader implementation, and how to create reports and alerts for operational actions.

The profile of attackers can vary greatly: cyber-criminals, lone hackers, ex-employees, and nation state agencies. The Cyber Deception Platform allows companies to be one step ahead of them and study what information they are gathering, their motives and the techniques they use to penetrate defenses. This valuable information is used to take defensive action against threat actors and strengthen previously unidentified weaknesses in security systems to reduce the risk of a breach. Armed with this knowledge, organizations are better prepared to stop intrusions.

The Cyber Deception Platform is the first product that automates the design, implementation, supervision and maintenance of cyber deception campaigns, across an organization’s entire spectrum of digital assets, such as servers, mobile phones, web applications, mobile applications and Wi-Fi access points.

MEMORANDUM OF SYSTEM VERSION RELEASE

SUBJ: MCRN SYSLOG DISPLAY CONSOLE; CORVETTE IMPLEMENTATION v1.1.1

Sir/Madam,

Attached please find details of the most recent version of the MCRN SYSLOG DISPLAY CONSOLE for CORVETTE-class vessels.

As per SYSTECHDEVCOM guidance, DISCONDIV has leveraged the ""new and improved"" dashboarding functionality in Splunk v8 to create this version of the MCRN SYSLOG DISPLAY CONSOLE.

The DISPLAY CONSOLE in this version runs seventy-five (75) real-time searches and visualizes live data from multiple shipboard systems. An Event Generator is included so that operations personnel may view historical data and current system events as they are generated.

This system is ready for immediate release and implementation into the systems of vessels which correspond to the class for which this system was developed. DISCONDIV stands ready to assist with deployment and user training, as per SYSTECHDEVCOM policy.

What is FRED®?
FRED® stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. FRED® contains frequently updated US macro and regional economic time series at annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily frequencies. FRED® aggregates economic data from a variety of sources- most of which are US government agencies. The economic time series in FRED® contain observation or measurement periods associated with data values. For instance, the US unemployment rate for the month of January, 1990 was 5.4 percent and for the month of January, 2000 was 4.0 percent.

It relies on the Splunk built-in archiving capabilities and Azure blob storage and tables via the usage of the Python SDK for Azure.

The framework and concept can be summarised the following way:

- Splunk automatically calls the AzFrozen2Blob.py Python script when a bucket is frozen from cold storage (assuming archiving is enabled on the index)
- The Python script accesses an Azure storage account and verifies in a pre-defined Azure storage table if that bucket ID has been archived already (management of buckets replication for Splunk indexers in cluster)
- If the bucket has not been archived yet, a tgz archive of the bucket is created and uploaded to the pre-defined container in Azure blob
- If the upload to blob is successful, the Python script inserts a new record in the Azure storage table with all the useful information related to this bucket
- If the upload is successful, the script exists with an error code=0 which instructs Splunk that the bucket can be frozen, otherwise the script exit=1 and a new attempt will be made automatically by Splunk

For the less technically informed, CLI stands for ""Command Line Interface"" while ""Auto"" is a reference to automation.

If you answer ""Yes"" to any of the following questions, you may want to consider downloading/installing this app with the assistance of your local friendly Splunk administrator/power user.

- Do you manage/support several (10+, 100+, 1000+, etc.) network devices that have a CLI (Command Line Interface)?
- Has your team been requested to meet a compliance mandate (e.g. periodic password change) for your numerous CLI compatible network devices ?
- Does your team spend numerous man hours performing management/support tasks on network devices that might be solved by automation via CLI?

For those folks that have had the good fortune to work/study within the IT networking and/or cyber security fields, you probably are aware that several brands/models of networking devices have a CLI (Command Line Interface). Examples of network devices are firewalls, routers, switches, gateways, servers, wireless access points, workstations/laptops, etc. Also you may be aware, the more modern network devices typically use the ssh (Secure Shell)  protocol to secure a CLI network session. It should be noted that this app only supports the ssh CLI protocol. In other words, this app does not support other CLI protocols like Telnet. 

For the more technically minded, the CLI Auto app provides a job engine (via a custom REST API endpoint) and an user interface to connect to several nodes (hosts) via ssh to execute and index (i.e. log to Splunk) the output of a Command Type (i.e. a set of CLI commands).",unrestricted,True,https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4234/,assisted,simple,956,0,live,False,no,3.0.5,cli-auto-for-splunk_305.tgz,8.2|8.1|8.0|7.3|7.2,unknown

./create_content.sh /opt/tmp/TA_SplunkStart_WireTransferEssentials

This will append the necessary files from the TA to the local directory of
SplunkStart as well as append the default.meta in the TA to SplunkStart's
metadata/local.meta directory.

Once the above script has run successfully, you may restart Splunk. 

Sample Data Pre-Reqs:

First, cd into TA_SplunkStart_WireTransferEssentials/lookups and copy the ""susplcious_ip.csv"" 
ile into your local machine 

Terminal command: cp susplcious_ip.csv 

Next, cd into TA_SplunkStart_WireTransferEssentials/samples and copy the wire_transfer.csv file 
into your local machine by using the same method as described above. 

Once these 2 files are saved in your local machine, open Splunk Web. 
Click on ""Settings > Add Data > Upload > Select File"" and choose the wire_transfer.csv file. 
Follow the on-screen steps until the file has been successfully uploaded. 

Now, click on ""Settings > Lookups > Lookup table files > Add New""
Select SplunkStart as your destination app, and select susplcious_ip.csv as your lookupfile.
Name the lookupfile and click save. 

Once the data and lookup files have been uploaded, you can begin exploring the Wire Transfer dashboards,
changing titles, and updating macros as you see fit. Once you become familiar with the searches and panels, 
feel free to add your own data!

It contains a list of English stop words that can be optionally ignored.

This is a pretty basic app.  Use it in a search like this:

    search some_string |wc fieldname 

The 'fieldname' is optional, if supplied then the words in 'fieldname' will be counted.  If omitted then _raw will be used.

To create a table / chart, use stats.

    search some_string |wc fieldname |stats sum(count) by word

By default, a list of (English) stop words are filtered & not counted in stats.  To disable the stop words (and get a full count of words) add 'usestopwords=f' to the command:

* Visualize cluster resources with real-time heat map of key performance metrics

This should make this add-on less prone to breaking when the output format of Bro changes, or when log types are added and/or removed.  Another benefit is that if log format changes, old and new logs will both continue to have correct fields.

The downside to this approach are the same as any index-time field extraction.  Index size may be increased and search performance may be reduced, and once the logs are input they are stuck with the fields they came with.

The Splunk GUI for SysStat provides visualization of the system activity collected with the SysStat package. This includes I/O transfer rates, paging activity, process-related activities, interrupts, network activity, memory and swap space utilization, CPU utilization among others. The statistics can be collected in near real-time from as many hosts as you like (potentially thousands). The SysStat package is already present in all major Linux distributions and likely already installed, is a non-intrusive, secure and lightweight way to collect system activity information.

Imagine being able to see output of vmstat, sar or iostat for any period in the past!

A unique feature of the app is the ability to show any available parameters of your choice in one graph.

It is suitable for an ad-hoc or permanent advanced performance troubleshooting and profiling. 

The analysis of historical performance data and the detection of bottlenecks allows the establishment of a baseline of the resource usage, predicts utilization and reduces costs, especially in cloud environment like AWS.

 * It needs to change test code to record known issues via annotation/decorator or structured config file, so the test results generated today cannot be associated with newly found issues/bugs immediately.
 * Known issues are recorded in database and can be associated to test results of some test run in any time, but this process needs to be done again for new test runs, and often in a manual way.
 * There is no mechanism to freely record the progress and status (e.g. investigating, fixing locally, under code review) of test failures triage. Even though it has such features, it is usually limited to specific test run.

This app provides a new way using Splunk tag-based searches to address these issues and help QA team triage their (functional) test failures in a lightweight approach.

Unfortunately this app won't tell you ""who"" made a change - but typically you can get a pretty good idea with the help of Splunk audit logs etc. 

Before each run, this app can run a btool dump of various conf files. This is important because individual savedsearches files reorder as they are updated through the UI, which makes diffs ugly. The btool dump is always in a consistent order.

When changes are detected, an email can be sent showing the list of changed files.

Currently, there seems to be no easy way to report on 
and dump out all all your alerts without clicking the mouse 1000+ times
 - especially if you have say 800+ alerts defined and running.

Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to dump out
all of the Splunk alerts you defined to a .csv file and review all your alerts with Excel?

Now you can.

This app provides a way for an organization or an individual to convert user defined alerts
contained in internal splunk savedsearches.conf files to a user friendly readout provided by a .csv file.

When you save searches and create alerts - Splunk stores them for you in a number of savedsearches.conf files.

You may have alerts defined in only one savedsearches.conf file or in many 
savedsearches.conf files depending on if different users are defining their own alerts.

The work flow to dump out the alerts is fairly easy:

First install this app.

Then select the app.

Once the app is selected:

The app has a search bar.

Enter a search of "" |  exportalerts list"" (without the "")  to get a list of where your savedsearches.conf files are stored.
For a list of relative paths to your savedsearch.conf files enter ""| exportalerts list"". 

Then run the search again with ""| exportalerts PATH "".  Where the PATH is a path you have cut and pasted from 
the ""| exportalerts list"" search 

The "" | exportalerts list"" command or search will give you a list of one or more paths to the savedsearch.conf files relative to this app.

Highlight and cut or copy each line and paste it into the "" | exportalerts "" command as a suffix.

For example:

| exportalerts ../../search/local/savedsearches.conf

Would be a correct search string to cause the app to list your alerts defined in this particular savedsearches.conf file

And once you get a list of your alerts then:

Lastly save this search with all your alerts listed below as a REPORT. 
Then run the report and export as a csv file.

To export a report as a .csv file - look in the far upper right of the app screen for a downward pointing arrow
into a horizontal bar. This is the export / download to .CSV icon which you want to use from a REPORT.

You can only download to a .csv file when you SAVE your search as a report.

For example: You located a savedsearhes.conf file and you issued ""| exportalerts ../../username/savedsearches.conf"" file and you see alerts below. 

Next - open the report. You will see the alerts listed below in the report.

Go to the upper right menu bar of the report. Look for export and export to .csv. The symbol / icon is a downward arrow into a horizontal line.

You can name the .csv file and it starts to download from your browser.

Once the .csv file is downloaded to your desktop use Excel.

   1. Parse every HL7 message from log entry.*
   2. Extract every segment within any HL7 v2.x message into it's own Splunk Field.**
   3. Extract every field within every segment in the message.**
   4. Provide examples on how to extract values from HL7 subfields.
        i.e. PID-5 contains family_name,given_name,middle_name,suffix,prefix,degree.
        Individual fields are created for each of these.
   5. Provide examples on how to enrich HL7 coded values with actual contextual descriptions.
        i.e. MSH-9 may have ADT^A08.
        A new field Message_Type will also be present with a value of ""Update Patient Information""

   If the logs come from Cloverleaf's Interface engine there are additional extractions for thread_id, client ip, and client port.

NOTE: When migrating to Splunk 7.2 Fields from HL7 Segments will only show up in Verbose search mode because they are extracted using DELIMS and not REGEX.

As such no setup is required after install - after installation you will be able to fully use the entire app.

This app's focus is allowing anyone to keep up to date of the development of the Covid19 pandemic. Specifically it allows you to track and compare statistics split by countries, provinces and states.   You choose which countries, states and provinces you are interested in, and which statistics you want to chart.    In a nutshell it will give you a way to short circuit many Covid19 discussions by saying ""you know I think we can just go look at this stuff and see for ourselves.""

2 requests

1) the selfish one -- please consider sending me an email to say hi.  It was a fairly large amount of work to create this app, and even tiny anecdotes of people using it does make my day. 

2) IF YOU INSTALL THIS APP,  PLEASE DO TRY TO UPDATE IT REGULARLY.  It does not fetch new data automatically,  instead you must update it to get new data.   

However, having said that,  if you do feel somewhat comfortable running a python script from the shell, there are two ways to update the data without updating the entire app version. 
1) On a smaller or more standalone instance (or on a wild-west non-SHC but distsearch instance),  you can log into the SH host, cd to etc/apps/covid19_sideview/bin   and run  

splunk cmd python refresh.py

  - Getting exasperated at elasticsearch management?
  - Feeling groggy at grokking?
  - Getting crabby at kibana?
  - Feeling suffocated by so many separate SIEMS?
  - Haunted by hunting in lucene?

Well, ELKomply is here to help.  By implementing customized Logstash http output filters to a Splunk HEC receiver (derived from open source elastic forums) you can get real time data fed straight from Logstash instances in your existing open-source SIEM infrastructure fed directly into Splunk ecosystem.  Not only that, but no more having to reingest data just to extract that new field you wanted or fighting your way through multi-index searching sorcery.  Wish ALL your data mapped to one CIM? So did we, and now it is (or soon will be)!  One day you may event be able to turn off those Elasticsearch instances and hunt those data feeds completely in Splunk.  Discerning Splunkers may ask ""but it this Enterprise Security compliant?"" You can bet your hot buckets it is and always will be! 

So come on down and let ELKomply help ease your transition to a better hunt?

ELKomply receives logs from ELK based platforms via HEC event tokens and preconfigured Logstash pipeline configuration files provided on accompanying github repository (https://github.com/mutedmouse/ELKomply_configs).  This app utilizes field aliases, extractions, calculated fields, and lookups to normalize data from host and network monitoring solutions to the latest CIM for compliance with Enterprise Security.

Currently the priority of effort is getting SecurityOnion 2.x data mapped over and then adding additional platforms and mapped datamodels.  Please check https://github.com/mutedmouse/ELKomply for out-of-band updates and non-release versions.

Evolven and Splunk® Integrated Solution
This solution allows Splunk users to correlate service degradation events and KPIs, with the actual changes carried in their environments – finding the root-cause in seconds.

What’s Wrong vs. What Changed.
Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) tells you exactly what’s wrong: the health of your service and application, when and where an issue exactly started, and its impact. But, as soon as you know what’s wrong, the immediate next question is: “what changed?” For example, the service performed well a few hours ago but not now…something must have changed!

Finally Know What Changed.
Evolven tracks down granular changes carried out in your endto-end environment. Evolven uses patented machine learning analytics for analyzing the changes it collects, and correlating them with ITSI and Splunk events and KPIs. This solution provides Splunk users with precisely the actionable insights they need for troubleshooting or preventing incidents before the trouble starts.

If you work in IT security, then you most likely use OSINT to help you understand what it is that your SIEM alerted you on and what everyone else in the world understands about it. More than likely you are using more than one OSINT service because most of the time OSINT will only provide you with reports based on the last analysis of the IOC. For some, that's good enough. They create network and email blocks, create new rules for their IDS/IPS, update the content in the SIEM, create new alerts for monitors in Google Alerts and DomainTools, etc etc. For others, they deploy these same countermeasures based on provided reports from their third-party tools that the company is paying THOUSANDS of dollars for.

The problem with both of these is that the analyst needs to dig a little deeper (ex. FULLY deobfuscate a PowerShell command found in a malicious macro) to gather all of the IOCs. And what if the additional IOC(s) you are basing your analysis on has nothing to do with what is true about that site today? And then you get pwned? And then other questions from management arise...

See where this is headed? You're about to get a pink slip and walked out of the building so you can start looking for another job in a different line of work.

So why did you get pwned? You know that if you wasted time gathering all the IOCs for that one alert manually, it would have taken you half of your shift to complete and you would've got pwned regardless.

occur for these terms. The purpose of this boiler plate Java Servlet is to
serve as a parameter collector for HTTP POST and GET requests that can be
customized for deployment.

The servlet developed here was tested on Apache Tomcat 6.x, although it should
work in any servlet container. To further solidify it's usage, the user
may want to investigate using log4j as the framework for log collection. In
the Tomcat implementation, the output is captured in a configurable log rotated
file to be monitored by Splunk.

The GeoIPCityLite DB is apart of the app so no internet connection is required and lookups are performed locally on your search head.  

The use is simple, pipe any search to ' lookup geoip clientip as <some_ip_field> ' If you do not have an IP field in your data you can use the rex command to extract one and perform a lookup

Example Searches:

eventtype=firewall_event | lookup geoip clientip as src_ip
sourcetype=syslog | rex field=_raw ""(?<ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"" | lookup geoip clientip as ip
